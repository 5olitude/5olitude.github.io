## Into the void???
There’s a part of me that wants to hit that git push origin main and let the world see what I’ve built. Let people know it was me. Let my name be attached to something I’ve spent countless hours perfecting.And then there’s another part—the part that whispers, “What if you just vanish?” What if I create another Git profile, drop the project into the void, and watch it take a life of its own? No expectations, no attachments, just pure impact.
