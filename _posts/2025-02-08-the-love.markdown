## The Love I Deserved

Life has a way of showing love in unexpected places. For me, it wasn’t in grand gestures or dramatic moments—it was in the quiet warmth of strangers, in the simple interactions that reminded me that I mattered.After long hours of work, serving food to people, I often felt drained, both physically and emotionally. Some days, the weight of my own thoughts made it harder to push through. Yet, in those moments, kindness found me.An elderly couple sat at one of the tables, enjoying their meal. Their laughter carried across the room, a sound so genuine that it softened something inside me. As I walked past, the old lady caught my eye.“Are you okay, pal?” she asked, her voice gentle but firm, as if she already knew the answer.
For a second, I hesitated. Could she see through the mask I wore? I forced a smile, but before I could reply, she said, “Keep a smile on your face, dear. You have a lovely one.”
Her words took me back to my grandmother—the way she used to encourage me when life felt overwhelming. The way she made me feel seen. In that moment, it wasn’t just advice; it was a reminder that I wasn’t invisible.Not long after, the old man beside her looked at me with kind eyes and asked, “You okay, son?”This time, I didn’t hesitate. I smiled—genuinely this time—and said, “Yes, sir. I’m okay.”
And for the first time in a while, I truly felt okay. Not because my problems had disappeared, but because someone cared enough to ask. Sometimes, love isn’t about grand declarations. Sometimes, it’s in the smallest moments—a stranger’s concern, a gentle nudge to keep going, the reminder that we’re not alone.
That night, as I walked home, I carried something with me: the love I deserved, even if it came from people I had just met. And maybe, just maybe, that was enough.
