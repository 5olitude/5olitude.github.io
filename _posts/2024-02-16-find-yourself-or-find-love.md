## Is it worth enough to fight for love or myself???
The year 2024 was incredibly difficult for me. I made the mistake of falling in love with a girl who tore me apart, leaving me questioning the value of love and loyalty. It’s been a year, and if I’m being honest, I still haven’t fully recovered. But here I am, in a new city—feeling like I’m in a different world, trying to find myself again.

If you find yourself alone this Valentine’s Day, know that this part is for you. Stay true to yourself, and the right people will eventually come into your life. Don’t rush—focus on improving yourself first. It won’t be easy seeing couples holding hands on the streets, and it definitely won’t be easy seeing your ex with someone new. But listen: now is the time to work on yourself. Build something that excites you, something that keeps you up at night because you’re passionate about it—not because you’re lost in heartbreak.

Relationships are important, but sometimes, a deep conversation with a best friend or a heartfelt talk with your parents can bring more peace than any romance ever could.

One of the hardest lessons I’ve learned is that when you’re at your lowest—especially if you’re an introvert—people will try to take advantage of you. One of my worst experiences happened while working as a chef. A girl, six years younger than me, bluntly said, “This is the reason why your girlfriend left you.” I broke down in tears right there at work. But that moment changed me. That was the last time I allowed anyone to control my emotions.

Those tears carried depth, just like the conversation between Wolverine and Deadpool—the kind that leaves you staring into the void, realizing just how much you’ve endured.

So if you’re struggling, remember: pain is temporary, but the strength you build from it will last forever.
